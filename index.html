<p><h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>Welcome to my web site homies! I'm a basketball player, a kong fu master, a real Asian born and raised in Taiwan, and a perfect student athlete. As you see I'm now playing basketball for the University of Maine, 
 and I am the third Taiwanese ever to play in NCAA Division 1 basketball.
 
 <p>You will be able to understand more about me in this website. Take your time, and enjoy my story. </p>

<h1>Basketball</h1>
I've dedicated most of my time in training, practicing, and playing in order to become a better basketball player.
I started to play basketball when I was 10, and I fell in love with it since then.

<h1>Now you've understood more about me, my country, and it's time for you to meet my family!</h1>
<p> I live in an apartment with my older brother, and my parents. My parents are kind of like the traditional Asian parents who really expect their kids to do great academically in school. 
I still remember there was one time that I failed in math test so my mom baned me from basketball practice. That's how strict Asian parents are! However, without my parents' support and 
guidance I wouldn't be able reach where I am right now. Probably won't even be close! </p>
If you're interest in my family members, there's the link of the website which I introduce them one by one with details.
