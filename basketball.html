<h2>What it means to me:</h2></p>
Basketball is not just a sport, it's the cure for everything. I started to play when I was 10, and whenever I feel stressed, upset, or mad, basketball is 
always the best way for me to calm myself down and rethink about stuff. Moreover, It has taken me to so many places. I've been to most parts of Taiwan and play
, I've been to other countries to compete in tounaments or attending camps. Basketball changed my life, and without it, I wouldn't be here in United States studying collefe and playing
the sport I love. To me, basketball is <i><B>everything</i></B>. </p>
