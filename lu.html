<p><h2>Introduction of Taiwan</p></h2>

Taiwan is located in between the southeastern coast of the Asian continent and the East Asian islands distributed among the western Pacific Rim. To the north lie Japan and the Ryukyu Islands; to the south are the Philippine Islands; to the west is Mainland China.

Taiwan is endowed with steep mountain ranges; therefore, great altitude differences occur throughout the island. Moreover, a lot of people come to Taiwan for hiking and looking for those beautiful views from the top of the mountains. </p> </p>
